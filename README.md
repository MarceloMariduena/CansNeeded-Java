# CansNeeded-Java
# author: Marcelo Mariduena

A painter needs a program to calculate how much paint to buy for a project.   A project can be anywhere from 1 to 5 rooms.  Each room has four walls and a different length and width.   Ceiling height can be either 8 or 10 feet high.  One can of paint can cover approximately 30 square feet.  The program must prompt user for number of rooms.  Then for each room, it must prompt for whether ceiling is 8 or 10 feet, length and width of the room.  For simplicity, we will ignore doors and windows in our square footage calculation.
Once all the data is entered, the program will print number of paint cans needed for each room and total number of paint cans needed for the project.  Remember, you cannot buy a fraction of a paint can so always round fractions of a can up.
